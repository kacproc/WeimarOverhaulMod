 inexperienced_army_desc:0 "As the United States moved toward World War II, the Army was ill-prepared. Besides personnel and equipment shortages, the Army's doctrine and tactics were World War I vintage. The 174,000-man U.S. Army ranked nineteenth in size in the world, behind Portugal and only slightly ahead of Bulgaria. Its half-strength divisions were scattered among numerous posts, its equipment obsolete, its reliance on the horse increasingly anachronistic. The feat of transforming the miniscule interwar Army to the great force that defeated the Axis in Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and Asia took considerable time and effort. The Army began to re-evaluate its doctrine in the Louisiana maneuvers, but it was not until after the lessons of the disastrous Battle of Kasserine Pass (as late as February 1943) were absorbed that the U.S. Army became a fully functional modern fighting force."
